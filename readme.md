# Antibot

## Description

As all of us are having similar feelings about ad-bots in telegram work chat's. I have found solution for  inner peace. 
Antibot:
When a new user joins the chat first bot restricts immediately notification and user should confirm being not a robot by clicking "I'm not a robot!". After antibotâ€™s message will be deleted and user allowed join the chat. If the confirmation failed after 24 hour bot will ban user account in chat.
All forwarded messages from the channels or bots will be detected and deleted immediately by our antibot. To allow some users to forward messages you can use `/addwhite` and `/removewhite` commands to add or remove a user from chat whitelist.
Bot catchs messages containing  `t.me/joinchat/<random-chat-id>` and `t.me/<bot-username>bot?start=somedata` link types. Similar action with whitelist.
A bot can report user all actions data in a separate chat/channel or even in pm. User will receive a message with all data (chat title, chat username (for public chat)) and nickname of suspicious content sender. It gives admins possibility to ban OR add to chat whitelist it immediately. 

NOTE: make sure that you are a chat admin before doing an action. 

## How to use

Add [@antibotuser_bot](https://t.me/antibotuser_bot) to a chat/superchat and give it admin rights. After bot will work as intended.

## Note

There's a whitelist of channels from which the bot allows forward messages. 
Only I can add and delete channels from this list. Contact me in case you want to add a channel to it.
If you wanna run a copy of my bot, create .env file and fill it the same as shown in .env.example.
